# Leveraging-Data-Science


With the cost of data storage consistently decreasing, data volumes are increasing, and organizations 
are no longer forced to only store the bare minimum data. The projects in this page examine the technology 
required to analyze and process Big Data. Topics include: Hadoop/MapReduce, Spark/RDD, Spark/Storm Streaming, 
TensorFlow, Keras Deep Learning, Kubernetes, and Docker.
