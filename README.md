# Project Examples


With the cost of data storage consistently decreasing, data volumes are increasing, and organizations 
are no longer forced to only store the bare minimum data. The projects in this page examine the technology 
required to analyze and process Big Data. Topics include: Hadoop/MapReduce, Spark/RDD, Spark/Storm Streaming, 
TensorFlow, Keras Deep Learning, Kubernetes, and Docker. 

I apply the concepts of statistics, algorithms, and models to interact with 
data for the purpose of predictive analytics. Predictive analytics has the capability to help organizations 
identify potential impacts to their business and to support business decisions. Concepts that are included 
are: bias/variance trade-off, app development, over-fitting and model tuning, regression models – linear, nonlinear 
(SVMs, K-nearest neighbors), regression trees, classification models – logistic regression, random forest, 
dealing with unbalanced data, feature selection, and predictor importance.
